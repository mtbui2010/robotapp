# robotapp — Claude notes

Next.js 14 dashboard (App Router, TailwindCSS, static export → Cloudflare
Pages) that talks to a `robot_agent`-based backend over HTTP.

This package is the **UI mode** of the three-mode robot stack:

| Mode | Lives in | Talks to |
|---|---|---|
| **UI / HTTP** | this repo (`robotapp/frontend/`) | `robot_agent` FastAPI over HTTP |
| **CLI** | each robot pkg (`kcare_robot/__main__.py`, …) | bootstraps in-process |
| **Python API** | each robot pkg (`kcare_robot.skills.*`) | bootstraps in-process |

The dashboard is **not** required to operate the robot — it is an
optional multi-user interactive layer.

## Backend contract

The dashboard hits these `robot_agent` endpoints (full list in the agent's
[api/](../robot_agent/robot_agent/api/) routers):

| Endpoint | Used for |
|---|---|
| `GET  /skills`          | populate the skill picker |
| `POST /skill/<name>`    | run a skill (body = params) |
| `POST /skills/reload`   | refresh registry after edits |
| `GET  /devices`         | list configured devices |
| `POST /devices`         | add a device |
| `GET  /diagnostics/boot`| boot-error inspection |
| `GET  /camera/<id>`     | MJPEG / WebRTC stream |
| `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /config/locations[...]` | per-site config profiles (see below) |

### Location config profiles

A robot backend stores one config folder per deployment site (its own
`connections.json` + global configs). The `DevicePanel` exposes a **Location**
picker (next to the Robot picker) to choose / add / rename / delete sites and
hot-switch between them. Wrappers live in [frontend/lib/api.ts](frontend/lib/api.ts)
(`listLocations`, `activateLocation`, `createLocation`, `renameLocation`,
`deleteLocation`); switching triggers a backend device reconnect, so the UI
refreshes the connections list right after. Sites are a **per-robot backend**
concept (distinct from the multi-robot URL registry kept in `localStorage`).

`POST /skill/<name>` is the same path the CLI mode (`<pkg> <name>::<inputs>`)
ultimately resolves through `SkillRegistry.execute()`. Two clients (UI +
CLI) calling the same robot simultaneously is **unsafe** — document this
in any operator-facing UI.

## Dev / deploy

```bash
make install            # npm install in frontend/
make run-frontend       # next dev on :3007
make build-frontend     # static export to frontend/out/
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=… make deploy
make deploy-status
```

Cloudflare Pages project: `robotapp`. Custom domain:
`robot.aistations.org`. Account ID is pinned in [Makefile](Makefile).
